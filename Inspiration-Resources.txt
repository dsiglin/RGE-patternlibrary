Why make a pattern library?
// A useful resource to help guide external designers/coders
// A necessary resource for internal design/coding
// Increase value of site to design community and thereby drive extra traffic

What should some guidelines / goals be for a pattern library?
// It needs to be comprehensive without being overwhelming. Realistically this means a new visitor be able to confidently sort through the library. This confidence will promote exploration. I think the library needs to serve both those looking for inpsiration and those wanting to learn what a pattern library is.

What probably wouldn't work for us on mailchimp -
// Mailchimp uses floats for a lot of stuff. We are using javascript and so that will impact our library
// [as our site takes shapes I'll put more in here]
