Why make a pattern library?
// A useful resource to help guide external designers/coders
// A necessary resource for internal design/coding
// Increase value of site to design community and thereby drive extra traffic

What should some guidelines / goals be for a pattern library?
// It needs to be comprehensive without being overwhelming. Realistically this means a new visitor be able to confidently sort through the library. This confidence will promote exploration. I think the library needs to serve both those looking for inpsiration and those wanting to learn what a pattern library is.

Random General Thoughts - 
// Since Chop Chop is doing the coding (correct?) we will probably have to pick their brains a bit to produce notes similar to what MailChimp has. Ex note - "When using the grid, wrap the columns using a line and use lastUnit for the last column. Refer to OOCSS base classes to learn more about the grid classes."
// How is Chop Chop coding this CSS wise?


Mailchimp library analysis -
What probably would work for us on mailchimp -
// The organization of elements is logically separated. The grid system is the best place to start things off.
// The color used to show grid gutter and padding is an excellent idea that is easily understood.

What probably wouldn't work for us on mailchimp -

Random thoughts - 
// I REALLY wish the nav system followed as you scroll, much better UX that way, in my opinion
