Why make a pattern library?
A useful resource to help guide external designers/coders
A necessary resource for internal design/coding
Increase value of site to design community and thereby drive extra traffic

What should some guidelines / goals be for a pattern library?
It needs to be comprehensive without being overhwhelming. I imagine this means not all variants of a pattern need to be shown. This also implies a new visitor be able to confidently sort through the library. I think it needs to serve both those looking for inpsiration and those wanting to learn what a pattern library is.
